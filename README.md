#Setup

Clone the repository and store it in your google drive

To clone  the respository to system

Install git on your system from 
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

## Use command
git clone https://github.com/njayanthadithya/Vehicle_detection_yolo.git

Download YoloV3 weights and save them in the same repository
Download the weights from this website - https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/

## Save the complete folder in your Google Drive
Open the Vehicle_Detection_using_YoloV3.ipynb file using google colab.

Change the runtime from CPU to GPU.

Mount your google drive. 

Upload your image and change the path to the image.
  
## About the project
In this project, we used YoloV3 pretrained weights to perform object detection on 80 different classes. The weights were trained on the COCO dataset which can be found at http://cocodataset.org/#home. The motive of the project was to implement object detection/vehicle detection on Indian roads.
